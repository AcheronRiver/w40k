# w40k
The goal of this is to show to potential employers (Hi if you're reading!) and to hopefully build something useful for my local Warhammer 40K group.

What I'm hoping to show in here -

A relatively basic app that will be deployed using Terraform and Ansible.  Secrets and inventory will be kept elsewhere and imported into the Ansible instance.
  -  The configuration should show some Devops/SRE sauce on top (load balancing, Kubernetes, etc)
  -  The app is probably going to start as a basic webpage so I can do all of the Devopsy bits first while I figure out the actual functionality.
  -  If I encounter a part where I need to make a decision, I will make a decision record in a txt file and explain my reasoning.  I'll try to reference the decision number in any corresponding code.

Otherwise thanks for coming by.
